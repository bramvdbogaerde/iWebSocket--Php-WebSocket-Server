<h1>Before</h1>
<p>Today I'm using stream_socket_server functions is PHP 5.<br/>
These functions work very well but have some issues in my code at least<br/>
I'm now looking to use socket_write and other handy functions that were already available in PHP4.</p>
<h1>Now</h1>
<p>I added these functions to this branch<br/>
You can test it out and give it a try.<br/>
Currently only one client can connect to the server<br/>
Only when the client closes the connection another user can connect to it.</p>
<p></p>
